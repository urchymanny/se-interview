Securing a REST API involves several key practices:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Encrypt all communication using HTTPS to protect data in transit from eavesdropping.
2. **Authentication**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth 2.0, API keys, or JSON Web Tokens (JWT), to ensure only authorized users can access the API.
3. **Authorization**: Enforce proper role-based access control (RBAC) or permissions for users and services accessing your API.
4. **Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of requests per user/IP to prevent abuse (e.g., rate-limiting using tokens or request throttling).
5. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all input to prevent injection attacks (like SQL injection or cross-site scripting).
6. **Secure Data Storage**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
7. **Use of CORS**: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) properly to limit which domains can access the API.
8. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and real-time monitoring for suspicious activities or security breaches.

These steps help ensure your API is resilient to common threats.
